Naviance by Hobsons is a comprehensive K-12 college and career readiness platform that enables self-discovery, career exploration, academic planning, and college preparation for millions of students across all ages and around the globe.

School districts and schools like CHS purchase Naviance to help students explore their interests and strengths and develop a course of study that matches long-term goals with an actionable plan. Take surveys, find a career, and search for colleges with Naviance's feature-rich web application.

Naviance also serves as a link for students to access [x2vol](https://www.x2vol.com/students.html), our online community service manager. Tracking hours is easy, and logging hours to meet CHS's service requirements is quick. Students can find service opportunities, too and write about their experience via Reflections. And x2vol matches service opportunities to the things students care about the most, so every hour matters even more.
