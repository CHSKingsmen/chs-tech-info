## Managed Apple IDs
*Adapted from Apple's [support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205918)*

Beginning with the class of 2021, we are taking advantage of a new educational offering from Apple called "Managed Apple IDs," which allow CHS to create and manage Apple IDs for our students.

To maintain a focus on education, these services are disabled for Managed Apple IDs: 
- App Store purchasing
- iTunes Store purchasing
- HomeKit connected devices
- Apple Pay
- Find My iPhone
- Find My Mac
- Find My Friends
- iCloud Mail
- iCloud Keychain
- FaceTime
- iMessage

However, with these Apple IDs, students are able to log into iCloud and iTunes U. CHS is also able to push out other [educational apps](/what-we-offer/ipad-software) to students' iPads.
