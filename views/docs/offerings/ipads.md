## iPads
In 2013, CHS began a 1:1 iPad program for all high school students, and it continues to this day.

#### One iPad per student
Every high school student will have the option to either lease an iPad from the school, or bring their own suitable iPad from home. Every device has at least 32 GB of storage to store all the books and apps a student might need.

For those students who lease their iPad from us, we also provide a very protective [case](https://www.stmgoods.com/ipad-cases/ipad-air-cases/dux-for-ipad-air#92=16') in order to keep the device, and all the information on it, safe. In fact, it is the student's iPad, and thus their responsibility to keep it safe, we strong recommend that they do not allow others to use their iPad.

Each iPad leased from CHS comes with full AppleCare + coverage. AppleCare+ for iPad extends repair coverage and 
telephone technical support to two years from the original lease date and adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage due to handling. Each incident is subject to a $49 service fee, paid by the parents.

#### Apps
While students in Grade 9 will not have the App Store available to add content, students in Grades 10-12 may have the app store available with parental permission. There are a plethora of education related [apps on the app store](href='https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGenre?id=6017&mt=8&ls=1') that could potentially help the students in their studies. We also provide many [apps](/what-we-offer/ipad-software) to the students for use in their studies.

Students who do not have the App Store may request (with parental permission) to have an app installed for educational purposes. If approved, there will be a designated time when the app store can be accessed and the app installed.

#### Monitoring
CHS has full authority to collect and/or inspect a student's iPad at any time, or to alter, add, or delete installed software or hardware. We also provide 24/7 internet content filtering both on and off campus. Parents are encouraged to also monitor the content on their child's iPad, and are able to request a report detailing web activity at any time.

Because the primary use of the iPad is for educational purposes, the teachers are able to control the use of the iPad at their discretion. They are able to use the [Apple Classroom](/what-we-offer/apple-classroom) app to offer fine-grained control of iPad use in the classroom, in order to keep students on task.

#### Cost
The technology fee for the 2017-2018 school year is $50. If your student chooses to lease an iPad from the school, it will cost $190. Both of these costs are charged through SMART Tuition.
