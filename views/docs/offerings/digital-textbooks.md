## Digital Textbooks
Since every high school student receives an iPad we are able to provide required course text digitally. This page 
will describe some of the ways we do that.

#### iBooks
iBooks is iOS's native digital book reader that comes on every iPad, iPhone, and Mac. It comes with a digital bookstore with over 2.5+ million books for sale. While much of the store sells traditional eBooks (like novels, for example), there is a significant selection of multi-touch enhanced books, especially textbooks. The science classes at CHS (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) all use these enhanced textbooks for their courses. Also, the English department uses iBooks as their preferred form of book distribution for the novels used in classes. Through the Volume Purchasing Program from Apple, CHS is able to purchase a mass amount of iBooks from Apple (often at a discounted price) and give redeemable codes to students so they can download them to their own devices.

Pearson provides learning resources for K-12 and even for higher education. Many of our textbooks come through Pearson, including for Literature and Math. Also, our college level Physics, Math, and History textbooks come through Pearson. The Pearson eText app is the iPad companion to Pearson’s eText browser-based book reader. It allows students access their titles in a bookshelf on the iPad either online or via download. With the eText app, book content is displayed with the highest quality fidelity to the print and online versions of the textbook. The app provides students and instructors with many of the same features available to browser-based eText subscribers. The eText app provides full-text search capabilities, highlights, notes, bookmarks, support for multimedia content, glossaries, multitasking, ability to create study groups and many other features.
