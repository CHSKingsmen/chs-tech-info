## Apple Classroom
*adapted from [Apple's support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206151)*

Classroom turns a teacher's iPad into a powerful teaching assistant, helping a teacher guide students through a lesson, see their progress, and keep them on track. With Classroom, teachers can easily launch the same app on every student device at the same time, or launch a different app for each group of students. Classroom helps teachers focus on teaching so students can focus on learning. Teachers can also lock students' iPads into an app, or lock the screens altogether, in order to keep students focused.

Teachers are also able to see what is on their students' iPad screens, and use AirPlay to show the students screen to the rest of the class through the Apple TVs that every classroom is equipped with.
