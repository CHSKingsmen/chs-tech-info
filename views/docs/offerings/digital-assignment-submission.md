Digitally turn in writing assignments, and get instant feedback on potential plagiarism. [Turnitin's Originality Checker](http://turnitin.com/en_us/what-we-offer/feedback-studio), and its database of over 730 million student papers and 60 billion web sites indexed, is used heavily by the English and History departments at CHS to ensure that all students' major papers and other assignments are truly their own.
